# Closet-Tracker App 
I created this app to track the inventory of my closet! Over the years I have collected a number of items in my closet that mean a lot to me. 
Because of this, I wanted to be able to upload my favorite pieces of my closet in order to keep track of them as well as notate any important pieces of information. 
For example, I can add notes indicating if I sold or donated a particular item. I can also add a text note that might tell me if an item fits or not, or maybe there is a hole in the knee of a pair of jeans. 
This app also keeps track of the date that the note was made so I can better track and additional notes I make.
