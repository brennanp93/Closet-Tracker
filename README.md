# Closet-Tracker App 
The Closet Tracker was created to keep track of those prized possessions in your closet.
I wanted a place where I could upload my favorite pieces of clothing - pieces that have a great story or the ones purchased from a small business. 
The Closet Tracker allows the user to upload images and details of whatever item they choose. From there, you can add additional notes later on if you'd like. 
For example, maybe you sold or donated a particular item? You can indicate that. You can even add a text note that might remind you if an item fits or not, or maybe there is a hole in the knee of a pair of jeans and when that hole appeared.

# Next Steps
- In the future I would like to be able to impliment a "search" and/or "filter" functionality for my closet.
- I would also like to add additional "delete" functionality.
